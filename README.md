# The-method-of-obtaining-a-part-of-the-dataset-based-on-molecular-similarity
The method of simplifying the dataset using similar matrices is applied to molecular property prediction(MPP)
first make a sdf file of molecule,and rename the file as A.sdf,use SDF_make.py to settle documents
second use mimilar——TRAIN.py,you will get a similar_trained_gcn.pth
third use similarity.py,you will get three csv files
fourthly use main_train.py 
in the end you can use test.py to verify the accuracy rate
